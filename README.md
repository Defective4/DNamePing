## What is DNamePing?
DNamePing is a fully customizable plugin to ping your players when they are mentioned in chat!
In addition to customizable sound alerts, player names can also be highlighted!

*Note*
For now the plugin configuration and in-game commands are by default Polish.<br>
English language support will be added in the future.<br>
However it does not affect plugin's functionality at all.

### Commands
- /npreload - Reloads plugin configuration

### Permissions
- dnameping.admin.reload - Allows access to /npreload command
